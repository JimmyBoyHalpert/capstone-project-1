        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm a frustrated/depressed developer who feels rusty and wants to upskill by re-runing through
            tutorials to refresh knowledge of things I've used in the past, haven't
            used in a long time, barely used at all, and things that I want to learn
            for the first time. I want to do more development outside of work so I can
            feel more confident about my coding in general because I'm unhappy with the
            status of my career and knowledge at this point. Hardworking in my professional life
            but maybe not enough in my personal life. Hopefully these repos will change that.
